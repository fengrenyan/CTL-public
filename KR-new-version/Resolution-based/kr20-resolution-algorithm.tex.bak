% Following comment is from ijcai97-submit.tex:
% The preparation of these files was supported by Schlumberger Palo Alto
% Research, AT\&T Bell Laboratories, and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.
% Shirley Jowell, of Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, and Peter F.
% Patel-Schneider, of AT\&T Bell Laboratories collaborated on their
% preparation.

% These instructions can be modified and used in other conferences as long
% as credit to the authors and supporting agencies is retained, this notice
% is not changed, and further modification or reuse is not restricted.
% Neither Shirley Jowell nor Peter F. Patel-Schneider can be listed as
% contacts for providing assistance without their prior permission.

% To use for other conferences, change references to files and the
% conference appropriate and use other authors, contacts, publishers, and
% organizations.
% Also change the deadline and address for returning papers and the length and
% page charge instructions.
% Put where the files are available in the appropriate places.
